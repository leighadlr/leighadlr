- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @leighadlr
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a non-traditional CompSci student interested in software development, computer programming, and cybersecurity.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and tinkering as I find new things to dive into. A long time ago, I taught basic statistics using R and RStudio, and have taught VEX and Lego Robotics to kids of all ages.
- I'm circling back around to coding after many years in other fields (e.g. scientific research, STEM education, and nonprofit fundraising).
