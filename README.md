- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @leighadlr
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a non-traditional first year CompSci student interested in software development, computer programming, and cybersecurity.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and tinkering as I find new things to dive into.
- I'm circling back around to code after 20 years in other fields (e.g. scientific research, STEM education, and nonprofit fundraising). I started long ago with BASIC and Pascal in secondary school, but was a biology major for my first undergraduate degree. Life pulled me in other directions... until now!
